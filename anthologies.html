        <em>Including my story 'A Knot for the Hawk'</em> <br> <br>

      <em> Trickery in Asgard / snarky outlook / even gods can be genderfluid</em> <br><br>

      This latest new book in the Myths, Gods & Immortals series offers an opportunity to explore the many facets 
      of Loki – shapeshifting Norse god, at once an ally of and at odds with the other Aesir. From ancient tales to 
      comics, TV and the movies, Loki's tempestuous relationship with the likes of Odin and Thor, his many forms and 
      offspring, and his ambivalent character make him the classic trickster and an inspiration beyond Norse mythology. 
      With a new introduction to the ancient stories, this powerful new title offers fresh perspectives with new stories 
      from open submissions from across the world. A feast of imagination focused in a classic setting, <em>Loki</em> is a joyful 
      celebration of an enduring character. <br><br>

      <b><em>Starship Librarians </em>, edited by Shannon Allen and JR Campbell (Tyche Books, coming August 2025) </b> <br>
        <em>Including my story "Through Time and Calamity" </em> <br> <br>
      <em>Librarians of the future / queer protagonist </em> <br><br>
      
      Badgered and beleaguered, the front line of the culture wars, enduring book bans, budget cuts, 
      and ruthless political theatre, it's a tough time to be a Librarian. Yet if there is to be a better 
      tomorrow, it will be built on the art and wisdom of today. Building community, preserving knowledge, 
      sharing art: simple principles demanding resolute determination and sincere empathy from those staffing 
      the desks and stocking the shelves. <br><br>
      
      And the Librarians of tomorrow? Librarians function above 
      the digital revolution's reach. Have we realized databases, search engines, and other tech tools can never 
      replace human librarians? In the hands of a master, such tools might increase their abilities, but the great 
      cathedrals of knowledge and monuments of literature will never be ruled by the soulless. You can't code empathy, 
      program taste, or script inspiration. It's time we recognize society should never replace empowered Librarians. <br><br>
      
      A bold Commander, brilliant science officers, resourceful engineers, but no starship crew is complete 
      without a librarian! <br><br>

      <em> Hansel and Gretel reimagined / chained limerick / dark fantasy</em> <br><br>

      
          Is the limerick only for dirty jokes? <br><br>
          In this original anthology, some of the best poets working today tackle that question by writing chained 
            limericks - poems where each stanza is a limerick. <br><br>
          You'll encounter dirges, existentialism, fantasy, science fiction, horror, postmodernism, and, yes, even some jokes. <br><br>

        <em>Including my story "Blood Stains True" </em> <br> <br>
      <em>Historical fantasy / 1500s Venice / trans protagonist </em> <br><br>
      
      Vampires stalk us from the shadows. They’ve been feeding on blood, our very life force, since before 
      words were pressed into clay. But we are not unprotected. For as long as vampires have hunted us, there 
      have been those who hunt them. This is a record, fragments of journals, letters and transcripts, collected 
      to chronicle how vampires can be identified, how they are evolving, slaying strategies, and the threat they 
      pose to humanity. <br><br>
      From Agamemnon to Edgar Allan Poe, Cape Canaveral to Kiribati, this Incomplete Record of 
      Personal Accounts explains the appetites, habits and horrors of these creatures of the night. Testimonials 
      have been gathered, organized, and passed on in a single book throughout history.  <br><br>
      With stories from Gwendolyne Kiste and A.C. Wise, as well as LCW Allingham, George K. Angelou, Juno Crew, William J. Donahue, 
      River Eno, Henry Herz, Mina Humiston, D.C. Kugtima, Camellia Landman, Carter Lappin, Caolán Mac an Aircinn,

      A black cat approaches - do you let it cross your path, or run in the opposite direction? From 
      the superstitious to the unlucky, from a witch's familiar to a soul stealing grave robber, black cats 
      have captured our imagination and remain solidly in the realm of the dark. <br> <br>
      
      Join authors from around the world for never before published horror, dark fantasy and mystery stories and poems around the beloved, feared and mystical black cat.

      Morgana is a mysterious figure of Arthurian legend, found in Gawain and the Green Knight and 
      Le Morte d'Arthur, she is variously described as half-sister of King Arthur, jilted lover of 
      Lancelot, a foil of Merlin. A witch, a healer, she has deep roots in Celtic mythology and offers 
      a fascinating canvas for the many writers in this new book. Created through open submissions and 
      supported by an extensive introduction examining the origins of Morgana le Fay, is a wonderful new 
      book in the best tradition of Flame Tree's collectable hardcover editions.

    <h2>2024 </h2>

    <p> <img src="/images/grimm.jpg" alt = "Grimm Retold cover" style="float:left;width:30%;height:10%;margin-right:15px;">
      <b><em>Grimm Retold</em>, edited by LCW Allingham and River Eno (Speculation Publications 2024)</b> <br>
        <em>Including my poem 'Gretel' - NOMINATED FOR THE 2025 RHYSLING AWARD! </em> <br> <br>

      <em> Hansel and Gretel retelling / dark fantasy / the real enemy in fairytales / a healthy dose of feminist fury</em>
      <br> <br>
      The glossy veneer of happily ever after has fooled readers into believing fairy tales are bright and happy stories, 
      but if you scratch the surface of any story  collected by the Brothers Grimm, it bleeds. Manipulation and murder. 
      Tension and torture. <em> Grimm Retold</em> cracks open the horror splattered between the pages of the old stories 
      to reveal the thriving darkness within these classic tales.
      <br> <br>
      Twenty stories and poems, from twenty authors, retell classic fairy tales; their teeth on the anxious 
      pulse that has always flickered from the hearts of Grimm’s collections. 
      <br> <br>
        Be warned; Grimm stories have never been so dark. 
      <blockquote> “Perfectly dark and perfectly lovely. This collection reclaims the grimmest bits of Grimm, 
        and makes them the star of each of these tales - told afresh for new audiences, but with a distinctly 
        classical feel.” - A.C. Wise, author of Wendy, Darling
