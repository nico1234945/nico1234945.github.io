      <blockquote> <em> My pa likes to say, his curmudgeonly jaw working at the spoon he often inserts 
        between his lips when he’s trying to suck the last vestiges of honey from the well-worn metal 
        ornamentation, that when he was a boy, maps were static things, only changing when wars were fought 
        and lost and won. <br>
        I usually like to remind him that we don’t have wars anymore.
